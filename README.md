# Music-Player-python-tkinter
This is the Music Player application made by using tkinter module in python

I made this application in different components soo that others can easily understand the project
I used mixer module of pygame module to play/pause the music beacuse mixer provides verious functions to control the music flow
you can also play music from different path.
you can also change the music cover image if you music file is not hav any music album picture then this default image get displayed
you can play/ pause the music and also move to next/previous music files using given buttons on the music menu
you will also get a menu at the top left corner
which contains two options, one is to change the music path and another one is to chnage the backgruond image of the music
this app play the music smoothly..
you can also get a progress bar at the bottom of the music cover image which will show you the amount of music played
and you can also fast forward the music using that progress bar

this app has lot of features that you can use when you play the music

thank you
